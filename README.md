# Paradise-Made-Easy

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

Travelling with groups can be hectic and stressful. Some people may ask repeated questions and things can get lost in group chats. The purpose of Paradise Made Easy is to provide a way to make planning group trips...well...easy! Answers to common questions and important trip information can be stored in one location, you can see a list of attendees, and post about your experience.

By building this application, we learned how to implement a single page application with React. With this being our first MERN stack application, we had to overcome some obstacles and learn how the front end and back end interact with each other via mutations and queries.

## Installation

Not applicable. This application can be accessed via the deployed link below.

## Usage

To use Paradise Made Easy, you can follow <a href="https://paradise-made-easy.herokuapp.com/">this</a> link. You can explore the different tabs made available to you and leave a post in the dashboard tab. In the future, we would consider allowing guests to create trips and send email invites to guests that they would like to come. We would also like to implement JSON web tokens so that we can authenticate login and make the dashboard more personalized.
